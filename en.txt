Last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states , has shrunk by 40 percent .
But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn t show the thickness of the ice .
The arctic ice cap is , in a sense , the beating heart of the global climate system .
It expands in winter and contracts in summer .
It expands in winter and contracts in summer .
It expands in summer and contracts in winter .
It is cold outside .
It is very cold outside .
